This guide will take you through how to make and link your own modules using `SpaDES` in two examples. Both examples draw on basic uses of statistical models in ecology, notably the relationships between enviromental variables and species abundance and presence. 

Example 1 is very minimal, and uses only dummy data. It is meant to introduce you to the different components of a `SpaDES` module.
Example 2 uses real and freely available data, and provides a deeper look into several useful aspects of `SpaDES`, notably caching and spatial data processing.

To install `SpaDES`, please have a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tati-micheletti/1de7505cdd387fe997f127f13eeb4393) to bypass known issues.

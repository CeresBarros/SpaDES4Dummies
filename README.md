# SpaDES4Dummies
A SpaDES crash-course

This tutorial intends to introduce you to the `SpaDES` `R` modelling platform. It **does not** cover installation aspects, or more advanced `SpaDES` utilities like caching.
It will, however, teach you how to set up your own modules from scratch and make them run together in a simulation.
All data used in this tuto is randomly generated, so there is no need to download data like in some other existing `SpaDES` modules.

To follow the tuto simply open the *.html* file amd follow the instructions.

Happy SpaDESing!

# SpaDES4Dummies

A SpaDES crash-course

This guide is an introduction to the `SpaDES` `R` modelling platform. It covers how to make and link `SpaDES` modules using `SpaDES` in two examples. Both examples draw on basic uses of statistical models in ecology, notably the relationships between environmental variables and species abundance and presence. 

The guide can be accessed [here](https://ceresbarros.github.io/SpaDES4Dummies/), and it is divided in two parts.

Part 1 is very minimal, and uses only randomly generated data (no dowloading necessary). It is meant to introduce users creating and linking `SpaDES` modules, introducing the different parts of a module and how a `SpaDES` model (i.e. group of linked modules) works.

Part 2 uses real and freely available data (that is downloaded by the created modules), and provides a deeper look into several useful aspects of `SpaDES`, such as automatically downloading and pre-processing spatial data and caching. This example also covers several good practices in the context of developing and sharing models built with `SpaDES`.

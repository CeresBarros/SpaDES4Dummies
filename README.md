# SpaDES4Dummies
A SpaDES crash-course

This guide is an introduction to the `SpaDES` `R` modelling platform. It covers how to make and link `SpaDES` modules using `SpaDES` in two examples. Both examples draw on basic uses of statistical models in ecology, notably the relationships between environmental variables and species abundance and presence. 

[Example 1](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CeresBarros/SpaDES4Dummies/blob/master/Example1_DummyModel.html) is very minimal, and uses only randomly generated data (no dowloading necessary). It is meant to introduce users creating and linking `SpaDES` modules, introducing the different parts of a module and how a `SpaDES` model (i.e. group of linked modules) works.

[Example 2](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CeresBarros/SpaDES4Dummies/blob/master/SpaDES4Dummies.html) uses real and freely available data (that is downloaded by the created modules), and provides a deeper look into several useful aspects of `SpaDES`, such as automatically downloading and pre-processing spatial data and caching. This example also covers several good practices in the context of developing and sharing models built with `SpaDES`.

To install `SpaDES`, please have a look at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tati-micheletti/1de7505cdd387fe997f127f13eeb4393) to bypass known issues.

# SpaDES4Dummies
A SpaDES crash-course

This tutorial intends to introduce you to the **`SpaDES`** `R` modelling platform. It **does not** cover installation aspects, or more advanced **`SpaDES`** utilities like caching.

It will, however, teach you how to set up your own modules from scratch and make them run together in a simulation.
All data used in this tuto is randomly generated, so there is no need to download data like in some other existing **`SpaDES`** modules.

You'll find the tutorial [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CeresBarros/SpaDES4Dummies/blob/master/SpaDES4Dummies.html).

[SpaDES installation](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/wiki/Installation), [caching and debugging](http://spades-workshops.predictiveecology.org/articles/09c-CachingAndDebugging.html)

Happy SpaDESing!

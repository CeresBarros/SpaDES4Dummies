# Preface {-}

This guide will take you through how to make and link your own modules using `SpaDES` in two examples. Both examples draw on basic uses of statistical models in ecology, notably the relationships between enviromental variables and species abundance and presence. 

Part \@ref(part1) is very minimal, and uses only dummy data. It is meant to introduce you to the different components of a `SpaDES` module.
Part \@ref(part2) uses real and freely available data, and provides a deeper look into several useful aspects of `SpaDES`, notably caching and spatial data processing.

To install `SpaDES`, please have a look at [SpaDES installation](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.install/tree/installFromSource#readme).
